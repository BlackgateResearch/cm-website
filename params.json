{"name":"Cm-website","body":"Principles and Practice of Conscientious Mechanism\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe universe is a vast machine, even the most massive of celestial events are \r\ngoverned by the interaction of the same set of physical rules that govern the \r\nminutiae of our daily lives. Any machine left unmaintained is bound to an \r\nentropic decline into chaos; a functioning universe needs engineers: this is us.\r\n\r\nHumanity represents the pinnacle of organised systems, our emergent intelligence \r\nhas allowed us to pick up the baton from evolution and be the masters of our own \r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nSome would look into the coldness of the mechanical universe and see a bleak \r\nprospect; we, however, see a system to be explored and harnessed to further the \r\ngrowth of our species.\r\n\r\nSome theists would say that a society without sin or the threat of damnation \r\nwould be an immoral one; we counter that argument with the observation that a \r\nperson choosing of their own free will rather than being motivated by the fear \r\nof spiritual punishment is performing a more honest individual act. Good and \r\nEvil, although subjective by their nature, can be translated into general rules \r\non which the majority can agree; good acts further society whilst evil acts harm \r\nit. There is no direct karma system in the universe but a long chain of cause and \r\neffect whereby acts with good intentions will normally cause good outcomes. A \r\nwell intended act that has no noticeable direct effect may be the root of a \r\ndesirable outcome at the end of a long chain of events or, at very least, a \r\nwell-intentioned act builds the character of the individual performing the it, \r\nstrengthening their predisposition towards good acts.\r\n\r\nThe beliefs of Conscientious Mechanism, therefore, are built around the core \r\ngoal of understanding the workings of the universe in order to act in a way that \r\nbenefits the greater good whilst, in the short-term, providing members of our \r\ngroup with the support to excel above the crowd. \r\n\r\nOur goals are, of course, highly ambitious and difficult to achieve in the \r\ncurrent socio-political climate; therefore, we are acting as a closed group, \r\ninviting members to join us only once they have been observed to exemplify the \r\nvalues that we aim to cultivate. When such a time arises that the prevailing \r\nculture of greed, ignorance, intolerance and selfishness makes way for a more \r\nenlightened, forward-thinking one, we will be ready to step forward and act as \r\nparagons of progress driving our culture to greater heights.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Operation of Conscientious Mechanism as a Group\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nConscientious Mechanism is a group of peers interacting on a pure democratic \r\nbasis; the group is completely self-governing and does not grant any external \r\nauthority jurisdiction over any aspect of it's operation. Any externally \r\nbestowed rank or position is rendered meaningless within the group; each member\r\nis to be considered on their words and actions.\r\n\r\nIt will benefit the group's goals to remain low-key, we will not publicise our \r\nexistence and will only reveal ourselves to potential members through personal \r\nrecommendation from existing members. Outside of the group, members are to act \r\nas individuals but are expected to learn from the teachings of their peers and \r\ncontinue to improve themselves and act in an exemplary fashion, inspiring the \r\npublic to emulate their behaviour. If questioned about the motives for their \r\ndeeds, a Conscientious Mechanist should simply reply that they are doing the \r\nright thing according to their personal beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe Conscientious Mechanist Oath\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nI [YOUR NAME] most solemnly and sincerely declare my intent to embody the values \r\nof Conscientious Mechanism:\r\n\r\n1. I will uphold moral values without exception and guide others \r\nsimilarly. I will never impose on others what I would not choose for myself.\r\n\r\n2. I will endeavour to further my understanding of all things, with the \r\nknowledge that all things are ultimately understandable.\r\n\r\n3. My body is the tool with which I realise my intentions. I will hone both my \r\nbody and mind in order to become a paragon of the virtues of Conscientious \r\nMechanism.\r\n\r\n4. My actions will always reflect my intent; my word is my bond.\r\n\r\n5. I will judge a person solely by their actions, taking no heed of preconceptions.\r\n\r\n6. I will fight for universal, unrestricted freedom of expression.\r\n\r\n7. I will constantly question authority. I will not impose arbitrary authority on \r\nothers nor will I accept the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfreedom of expression\r\na person's thoughts are their own\r\n\r\n[Notes:]\r\n - The does not exist a good enough reason to undermine your morals.\r\n - Time is finite, don't waste it on...\r\n - Equality \r\n - Further one's self in all ways and, as a direct result, become a paragon of good and a positive catalyst to change\r\n - Give fealty to no imposed authority and do not impose autority onto others; respect can only be earned not expected.\r\n - Question authority\r\n - My word is my bond\r\n - Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself.\r\n - seek to understand all that I survey\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honour are steadfast. My word is my bond.\" - SEALs Creed\r\n \r\n \r\n most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear\r\n \r\n of my own free will and accord\r\n \r\nwith a firm and steady resolution \r\n\r\n#################################################################################\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nA forum for free discussion and the dissemination of information.\r\n\r\nAn academy for the exchange of knowledge and skills\r\n\r\nA pool of resources to help individuals and the group advance.\r\n","tagline":"Code for ConscientiousMechanist.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
